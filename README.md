# Hospitality Management Analysis

Introduction :

In the dynamic world of luxury hotels, AtliQ Grands encountered revenue challenges that endangered its market share. As an aspiring Data Analyst, I took on the challenge to improve the fortunes of this prestigious 5-star hotel chain in India.

Noteworthy Facts About AtliQ Grands :

‚û°Ô∏è AtliQ Grands stands as a five-star hotel chain with a presence in four major cities.

‚û°Ô∏è Across these urban centers, AtliQ Grands operates a network of seven unique properties, each strategically located to cater to diverse clientele.

‚û°Ô∏è To enhance guest convenience, AtliQ Grands offers reservations through six major booking platforms, optimizing accessibility and ease of booking.

üöÄ Project Scope :

My mission was to leverage several datasets to extract valuable insights that would lead to informed decision-making at AtliQ Grands.

fact_booking: Contains data on booking ID, booking date, number of guests, room details, ratings given, revenue generated, and revenue realized. This table is pivotal for decision-making processes.

fact_aggregated_bookings: Holds data on property ID, check-in dates, room categories, successful bookings, and capacity, crucial for key booking and occupancy metrics.

dim_date: Contains date-related info, including dates, week numbers, and day types (weekend/weekday) for analyzing booking trends over time.

dim_hotels: Details properties (property ID, name, category, cities) essential for understanding the hotel's characteristics.

dim_rooms: Provides room IDs and classes to analyze room popularity and profitability.
